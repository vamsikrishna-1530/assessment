# Agile Methodologies and Story Point Estimation Process

## Agile Methodologies Used in Our Project

### 1. Scrum

- **Description**: Scrum is a framework that facilitates teamwork and encourages iterative progress towards a well-defined goal. It breaks down the work into sprints, typically 1-4 weeks long.
- **Usage**: We use Scrum for projects that require rapid product iterations. It helps in managing complex software and product development.

### 2. Kanban

- **Description**: Kanban is a visual approach to project management that manages work by balancing demands in real-time with available capacity.
- **Usage**: We use Kanban for projects that require continuous delivery without overburdening the development team.

### 3. Lean

- **Description**: Lean methodology seeks to produce high-quality products rapidly by eliminating waste through continuous improvements.
- **Usage**: Employed in projects where efficiency is paramount, and the goal is to deliver value to customers as quickly as possible.

## Story Point Estimation Process

### Step 1: Understand the User Stories

- Before any estimation begins, ensure that each user story is clear and concise. Each story should have enough detail for the team to understand what is required without being too prescriptive.

### Step 2: Basing Estimation on Complexity and Effort

- Story points measure the complexity and effort involved in implementing a story, not the time it takes. Points are assigned based on how challenging the story is relative to others.

### Step 3: Use Planning Poker

- **Tool**: Planning Poker is a consensus-based technique used to estimate effort or complexity in Agile projects.
- **Process**:
  1. Each team member gets a set of cards with numbers representing potential story points.
  2. Product Owner reads a user story.
  3. Each team member privately selects a card representing their estimate.
  4. All cards are revealed simultaneously.
  5. Discuss discrepancies in estimates, and re-estimate until the team reaches a consensus.

### Step 4: Calibrate Estimates

- Compare new user stories to those that have already been estimated. This helps in maintaining consistency across estimates.

### Step 5: Revisit and Revise

- Regularly review and adjust story points as necessary, particularly if significant new information comes to light, or if tasks are completed more quickly or slowly than expected.

### Step 6: Track Velocity

- **Definition**: Velocity is the average number of story points completed during a sprint.
- Use velocity as a guideline for planning future sprints. It helps in predicting how quickly the team can work through the backlog.

## Conclusion

Implementing Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Lean along with a robust story point estimation process helps in streamlining the development process, ensuring flexibility, and improving delivery effectiveness. This methodology and estimation strategy drive productivity and efficiency in project execution.
