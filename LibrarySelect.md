When selecting a library for a ReactJS application, a holistic approach combining multiple criteria is crucial for ensuring the technical effectiveness and efficiency of the application. Below, we'll explore each important factor in a more technical-oriented manner and explain how they contribute to making an informed decision:

1. **Bundle Size and Performance**: 
   The size of the library has a direct impact on the application's loading time. Smaller bundle sizes ensure faster page loads, which enhance user experience and SEO. Tools like Bundlephobia can be used to assess the size impact of adding a new library. Performance also involves checking if the library leverages modern Web standards like HTTP/2 and lazy loading.

2. **Compatibility with ReactJS**: 
   Ensure that the library supports the ReactJS version you are using. This includes checking for hooks support if you are using the latest versions of React, or lifecycle methods for older versions.

3. **Community Support and Popularity**: 
   A large community means more frequent updates, extensive testing, and a plethora of tutorials and discussions available. GitHub stats such as stars, forks, and issues can provide a snapshot of the library’s popularity and community activity.

4. **Maintenance**: 
   Active maintenance indicates the library is regularly updated to fix bugs, patch vulnerabilities, and improve functionality. Regular commits and recent release dates in the GitHub repo are good indicators of active maintenance.

5. **Documentation Quality**: 
   High-quality, comprehensive, and easy-to-understand documentation is essential for accelerating development and easing integration challenges. Good documentation should include examples, API references, and guides.

6. **Licensing**: 
   Ensure the library’s license is compatible with your project's licensing requirements. Some licenses might impose constraints that could affect the commercial use of your application.

7. **Functionality and Ease of Use**: 
   Evaluate whether the library meets your specific needs without additional overhead. It should have a straightforward API that meshes with your existing codebase seamlessly. This reduces learning curve and development time.

8. **Security**: 
   Libraries should be secure by design and receive regular security updates. Use tools like Snyk or GitHub's security advisories to check for vulnerabilities associated with the library.

9. **Browser Compatibility**: 
   Compatibility across all browsers that your application intends to support is critical. This includes ensuring that the library behaves consistently across browsers, including mobile browsers.

10. **Accessibility (a11y)**: 
    For universal accessibility, choose libraries that follow WAI-ARIA standards and enhance your app's usability across different assistive technologies.

11. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Compatibility**: 
    For projects using SSR, it’s important to ensure that the library can render on the server. This means it should not rely exclusively on browser APIs and should handle server-specific logic when necessary.

12. **Tree Shaking and Modularity**: 
    Check if the library supports tree shaking to help eliminate unused code at the bundling stage. A modular library allows importing only the necessary parts, reducing overall bundle size.

13. **Dependency Overhead**: 
    Evaluate the library's dependencies to ensure they do not introduce unwanted bloat or outdated libraries into your project.

Technical evaluation often involves setting up a testing environment where the library is integrated into a part of your application to assess real-world performance, compatibility, and integration issues. Profiling tools and performance benchmarks can be used to measure the effect of the library on application performance. Conducting a thorough evaluation based on these criteria makes it more likely that the chosen library will meet the project's needs effectively and sustainably.
