# AWS Interview Questions for Full Stack Developer

## AWS General Questions

1. **What is AWS and what services does it provide?**
   - AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud platform by Amazon providing compute power, storage options, and various services for businesses.

2. **Explain the key components of AWS.**
   - Some of the key components include:
     - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
     - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
     - RDS (Relational Database Service)
     - Lambda
     - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
     - IAM (Identity and Access Management)

3. **What is the use of Amazon EC2?**
   - Amazon EC2 allows users to rent virtual servers on which they can run their own applications.

4. **Can you differentiate between Scalability and Elasticity?**
   - Scalability is the ability to handle an increase in workload by adding resources. Elasticity is the ability of a system to automatically add or remove resources as needed.

## AWS Technical Questions

1. **How do you secure data in AWS?**
   - You can secure data in AWS using:
     - IAM (for access control)
     - Security Groups and Network ACLs (for network security)
     - Encryption (using services like KMS, SSE, and HSM)

2. **What is Amazon RDS and what are its benefits?**
   - Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that allows you to set up, operate, and scale a database in the cloud. Benefits include cost efficiency, scalability, and automated patching and backups.

3. **Explain what a VPC is and its advantages?**
   - VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud; it allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a defined virtual network. The advantages include network security customization and using multiple layers of security.

4. **How does the AWS Load Balancer work?**
   - An AWS Load Balancer distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones, which increases the fault tolerance of applications.

## AWS Full Stack Specific Questions

1. **How would you integrate AWS services in your full stack applications?**
   - You can integrate AWS services like DynamoDB for database, S3 for storage, Cognito for authentication, and Lambda for serverless compute in your application.

2. **How do you manage state in a serverless architecture in AWS?**
   - State management can be achieved using AWS DynamoDB to maintain state information, or by using caching services like ElastiCache.

3. **What are some ways to optimize performance of a full stack application in AWS?**
   - Utilizing AWSâ€™s content delivery network (CDN), CloudFront, to reduce latency, leveraging Elastic Cache to enhance data retrieval speeds and S3 with CloudFront for static asset caching are some of the strategies.

4. **Describe the CI/CD process for a full stack application using AWS.**
   - Using AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment, which automates build, test and deploy phases when there is a code change based on the defined release process models.

## Conclusion

Make sure to back your answers with practical examples or past experiences when possible. Understanding these concepts will not only help in handling interviews but also in efficiently utilizing AWS services in various projects.
