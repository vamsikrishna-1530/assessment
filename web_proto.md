Here are detailed React.js and web communication-related interview questions and answers based on your reassessment feedback:

### **1. What are the different ways to establish real-time communication in a React application?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Real-time communication can be established using:  

1. **WebSockets:** A bidirectional communication protocol that keeps a persistent connection open.  
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** A unidirectional mechanism where the server pushes updates to the client.  
3. **Polling (Short/Long Polling):** The client requests updates at intervals (short polling) or waits for a response until there is an update (long polling).  

Each method has **pros and cons**:  

| Method | Pros | Cons |  
|--------|------|------|  
| **WebSockets** | - Real-time, low-latency communication.<br>- Full-duplex (both client and server can send messages anytime). | - Requires WebSocket-compatible servers.<br>- If the connection drops, manual reconnection handling is required.<br>- Not ideal for low-priority updates (high resource usage). |  
| **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** | - Simpler than WebSockets (uses HTTP).<br>- Works well for one-way data updates (e.g., notifications, logs).<br>- Automatically reconnects if connection drops. | - Only supports unidirectional communication (server to client).<br>- Not ideal for chat applications where client needs to send messages.<br>- Limited browser support compared to WebSockets. |  
| **Polling (Short/Long)** | - Works with any HTTP server.<br>- No special protocol needed. | - High server load (constant requests).<br>- Latency issues with short polling.<br>- Inefficient compared to WebSockets/SSE. |

### **2. What happens when a WebSocket connection fails, and how can we handle reconnection?**  
#### **Answer:**  
When a WebSocket connection fails, the browser does not automatically retry the connection. This can happen due to:  

- Network interruptions.  
- Server restarts or crashes.  
- Proxy or firewall restrictions closing idle connections.  

#### **Solutions for Handling Reconnection:**  
1. **Exponential Backoff Retry:** Attempt reconnection with increasing time intervals (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, etc.) to reduce server load.  
2. **Heartbeat Mechanism:** Send periodic ping messages from the client to detect inactivity.  
3. **Detecting Connection Closure:** Listen for the `onclose` event and trigger a reconnect attempt.  
4. **Graceful Handling on Unload:** Close WebSocket properly before a user navigates away (`window.beforeunload`).  

Example Reconnection Code:  
```javascript
function setupWebSocket() {
  const ws = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/socket');
  let retryInterval = 1000; // Start with 1 second

  ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket connected");
    retryInterval = 1000; // Reset on success
  };

  ws.onclose = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket disconnected. Retrying...");
    setTimeout(setupWebSocket, retryInterval);
    retryInterval = Math.min(retryInterval * 2, 30000); // Max 30 seconds
  };

  ws.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
    ws.close();
  };

  return ws;
}
setupWebSocket();
```
**Pros of Handling WebSocket Failures:**  
✅ Provides a seamless user experience.  
✅ Prevents excessive connection attempts that could overload the server.  

**Cons:**  
❌ Requires extra logic for reconnection.  
❌ Exponential backoff can introduce delays if users expect real-time updates.

### **3. When should you use WebSockets, SSE, or Polling in a React app?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Choosing the right communication method depends on the use case:  

| Use Case | Best Choice | Why? |  
|----------|------------|------|  
| **Chat Application** | WebSockets | Low latency, bidirectional communication. |  
| **Live Stock Prices** | WebSockets | Real-time updates, efficient. |  
| **Live Notifications (e.g., Twitter updates)** | SSE | Unidirectional, efficient for pushing updates. |  
| **Live Scores (One-way updates)** | SSE | No need for two-way communication. |  
| **Fetching Data Periodically (e.g., latest news)** | Polling (Short/Long) | Works on all servers, simple implementation. |  
| **IoT Device Monitoring** | WebSockets | Continuous real-time communication needed. |  

---

### **4. How does long polling work, and how is it different from WebSockets?**  
#### **Answer:**  
Long polling is a technique where the client sends a request to the server and waits for a response. The server holds the request open until there is new data. If data is available, it responds, and the client immediately sends another request.  

**Differences Between Long Polling & WebSockets:**  

| Feature | Long Polling | WebSockets |  
|---------|-------------|------------|  
| **Communication** | Client repeatedly requests updates. | Persistent connection, updates in real-time. |  
| **Efficiency** | High resource usage due to multiple HTTP requests. | More efficient, single connection for multiple messages. |  
| **Latency** | Slight delay in receiving data. | Low latency, real-time communication. |  
| **Implementation Complexity** | Simple, works with any server. | Requires WebSocket-compatible server. |  

**Pros of Long Polling:**  
✅ Works on all servers (doesn’t need special WebSocket support).  
✅ Can be easier to implement if WebSockets aren’t supported.  

**Cons:**  
❌ Inefficient due to frequent HTTP requests.  
❌ Delays in receiving updates compared to WebSockets.

### **5. What is a good strategy for handling WebSocket disconnections due to network issues?**  
#### **Answer:**  
A reliable strategy includes:  

1. **Auto-Reconnect on Failure** (using exponential backoff to prevent overloading the server).  
2. **Ping-Pong Messages** (to detect inactive connections before they close).  
3. **Fallback to Polling or SSE** if WebSockets keep failing (use a progressive enhancement approach).  

**Example of Fallback to Polling:**  
```javascript
let useWebSocket = true;
let ws;

function connect() {
  if (useWebSocket) {
    ws = new WebSocket('wss://example.com');
    
    ws.onopen = () => console.log("Connected via WebSocket");
    ws.onerror = () => fallbackToPolling();
    ws.onclose = () => fallbackToPolling();
  } else {
    fallbackToPolling();
  }
}

function fallbackToPolling() {
  console.log("Switching to polling...");
  useWebSocket = false;
  setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/updates');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log("Polling Data:", data);
  }, 5000);
}

connect();
```
**Why is this important?**  
- If WebSockets are unavailable (e.g., corporate firewalls block them), the app can still function.  
- Polling ensures a degraded but functional experience.
